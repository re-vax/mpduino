Arduino based MPD client with touch screen and ethernet schields

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Still in development.

Now I'm creating a GUI library with labels, buttons etc...

The app is already able to communicate with my MPD server to get and display the current playing song artist/title/album/

Lot's of code to piss and not so much time so if you want to help me, you're welcome ;)
